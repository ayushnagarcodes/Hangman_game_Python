# Hangman Game
- I tried to create a game which is called hangman. It was a fun process and I learnt a lot of things about string and list formatting, handling input and if-elif-else statements.
- Some important features:-
  - It prompts user for any invalid or repeated inputs.
  - It has a menu which allows user to play more than 1 match or to exit the game.
